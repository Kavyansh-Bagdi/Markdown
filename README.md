In mathematics, the **dot product** or **scalar product**[^1] is an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually coordinate vectors), and returns a single number. In Euclidean geometry, the dot product of the Cartesian coordinates of two vectors is widely used. It is often called the **inner product** (or rarely the projection product) of Euclidean space, even though it is not the only inner product that can be defined on Euclidean space (see Inner product space for more).
The name "dot product" is derived from the [dot operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) " Â· " that is often used to designate this operation[^2] the alternative name "scalar product" emphasizes that the result is a scalar, rather than a vector (as with the vector product in three-dimensional space). 

## Definition

The dot product may be defined algebraically or geometrically. The geometric definition is based on the notions of angle and distance (magnitude) of vectors. The equivalence of these two definitions relies on having a Cartesian coordinate system for Euclidean space. 

**Coordinate definition**

The dot product of two vectors $ {\displaystyle \mathbf {a} =[a_{1},a_{2},\cdots ,a_{n}]} $ and ${\displaystyle \mathbf {b} =[b_{1},b_{2},\cdots ,b_{n}]} $, specified with respect to an orthonormal basis, is defined as

$$ \displaystyle \sum_{k=3}^{5} k^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 50 $$

## Python Code for Dot-Product

> [!TIP]
> Copy this code and try to run in your local machine

```python
# function for dot product
def dotProduct(vect_A, vect_B):

    product = 0

    # Loop for calculate dot product
    for i in range(0, 3):
        product = product + vect_A[i] * vect_B[i]

    return product
```

[^1]: The term scalar product means literally "product with a scalar as a result". It is also used sometimes for other symmetric bilinear forms, for example in a pseudo-Euclidean space. Not to be confused with scalar multiplication.
